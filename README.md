# config
My config files. Not an expert ricer; just wanted to have a repo to put my stuff whenever I bounce around environments.

## 2024-03-01 update: moved to i3 instead of sway
- deleted sway stuff
- will update with i3-related files when it is more serviceable

## utilities/stuff from fresh
`sudo apt-get install i3`
`sudo reboot`

## essentials
- git
    - `sudo apt install git-all`
- make
    - `sudo apt-get install build-essential` 
- keyd
    - `git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd`
